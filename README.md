# Description

File "video_to_joints.py" can take input from the video file or webcamera and save joints to a file

File "joints_to_midi.py" can take saved joints and calculate midi values for joints

File "midi_player.py" can take saved midi values and play them (e.g. to control Charanter in Adobe Character Animator)

File "webcam_and_midi_realtime.py" is the most buggy. Can transmit joints to Character Animator in real time for broadcasts


This repository uses google MediaPipe to recognize the arms on the camera and use them to control character in Adobe Character Animator.
